Rain Removal Code
=============================================================================================
Version 1.0, 17-Aug-2017

This package contains the MATLAB implementation of "Should We Encode Rain Streaks in Video as 
Deterministic or Stochastic?".

The code has been tested with MATLAB 2016b on a Mac.
